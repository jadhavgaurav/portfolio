# Cinematic AI Portfolio

A high-performance, immersive portfolio website built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. Designed to showcase AI engineering projects with cinematic visual fidelity.

## 🚀 Technlogy Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (Motion for React) & CSS Keyframes
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Fonts:** Space Grotesk & JetBrains Mono (via `next/font`)

## ✨ Features

- **Cinematic Visuals:** Ambient backgrounds, particle effects, and holographic UI elements.
- **Interactive UI:** Custom cursor, magnetic buttons, and 3D tilt effects on project cards.
- **Performance:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for initial load, optimized fonts, and minimal client-side hydration.
- **Responsive:** Fully responsive design adapting to all device sizes.
- **Clean Code:** Modular component architecture with strict TypeScript typing.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This project aims to merge the rigorous precision of engineering ("Neural Intelligence") with the fluid creativity of art ("Cinematic"). The "void black" background with neon accents (#00F0FF, #D946EF) creates a futuristic, cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic.
